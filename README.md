# mint

Description: get_transactions.py is a python script which authenticates the user into Mint and loads the data into a MySQL database.

1. Create your Looker instance.
2. Setup your database. For this code I've created a MySQL database, but it would be pretty easy to modify the code for a Postgres db.
3. Insert values for mint and database in the get_transactions.py file.
4. Execute the load_mint shell script.
