# mint

Description: get_transactions.py is a python script which authenticates the user into Mint and loads the data into a MySQL database. If you would like to use a postgres DB instead, it should be pretty easy to modify the script for a postgres library instead of the MySQLdb library. I think importing and using the psycopg2 library would work.
